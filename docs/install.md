# Installation

## Install the Azure CLI
The Azure CLI team maintains a script to run all installation commands in one step. This script is downloaded via curl and piped directly to bash to install the CLI.

*If you wish to inspect the contents of the script yourself before executing, simply download the script first using curl and inspect it in your favorite text editor.*

```console
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```
